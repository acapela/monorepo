/**
 * This is a bit of a magic.
 *
 * The goal here is to stretch the calendar a bit so days on left and right are 'touching' the sides of the calendar.
 *
 * ie. assume such week grid
 * |                CALENDAR                 |
 * |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 *
 * As can be seen, 1 and 7 are not 'touching' the side borders of the calendar.
 *
 * The goal is something more like:
 * |              CALENDAR               |
 * |1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7|
 *
 * It might look incorrect, but only if border is visible.
 *
 * To achieve such look, easy approach can be to use negative left/right margin.
 *
 * Now, how much of such margin:
 * For
 * |  1  |
 * to become
 * |1  |
 * we 'horizontal' padding from one side.
 *
 * We don't know this padding as content of the cell is just centered text.
 *
 * Therefore we need 'half of cell width reduced by half of text width'
 *
 * half of sell width is 100% / 7 / 2
 *
 * half of text size is 1ch (1 character width as in calendar we can have at most 2 chars - '31')
 *
 * Thus 100% / 7 / 2 - 1ch expressed as negative margin is calc(-100% / 7 / 2 + 1ch)
