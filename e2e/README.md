## Slack

To run the Slack tests locally you need to have Slack set-up (see main README) and

- set `TEST_SLACK_EMAIL` & `TEST_SLACK_PASSWORD` env variables based on a test
  account you should have created for the purpose of testing
  - you can use https://alepaca.slack.com/ as a test workspace
- set your Slack app to be public distributed (under "Manage distribution")
